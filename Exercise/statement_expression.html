                    Write a JavaScript code to make online booking of theatre tickets and calculate the total price based on the below conditions:
                    If seats to be booked are not more than 2, the cost per ticket remains $9.
                    If seats are 5 or more, booking is not allowed.
                    If seats to be booked are more than 2 but less than 5, based on the number of seats booked, do the following:
                    Calculate total cost by applying discounts of 5, 7, 9, 11 percent, and so on for customer 1,2,3 and 4.
                    Try the code with different values for the number of seats.
